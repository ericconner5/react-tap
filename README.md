# Shady's Kegs - A Pub's Keg Database

This project was made with React.

## Created by Eric Conner

## Description

An Epicodus project made in React that is mock-up of an Angular project. The initial main objectives are to set up a development environment using npm. Project includes Webpack bundling, Babel transpiling, a dev server with hot module replacement and linting. The application uses React-Router library for client side "multiple page" views. Some basic CSS styling is used with inline and object techniques.


## Notes

So far React has been more intuitive than Angular. I'm not wasting much time navigating to wrong editor pages. It feels similar to Angular regarding the process of setting up modules/components for basically each function. Also having some amounts of JS and html crossing over into each others previously well sanctioned territories. Styling seems even more open ended than normal CSS as there are a few ways to add styling into the functions. This presents some curious challenges to overcome: reckoning which is easiest or best for different use cases and getting used to another previously non-combined data-types combination.
